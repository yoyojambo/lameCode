LameCode is a simple code problem platform written in Go. It compiles and tests code in
multiple languages inside WebAssembly sandboxes, securely and efficiently, all from a
lightweight Go backend with HTMX on the frontend. Submissions are stored in a Turso (or
local SQLite) database.

* ‚ú® Features

- Compiles and runs code in Go, TinyGo, C, C++, and Rust
- Executes code in WebAssembly using Wasmtime for isolation
- Uses local compilation, no external APIs
- Server-side evaluation, no exposed runtimes
- Built with Go (Gin) + HTMX, no JS framework

* üß± Tech Stack

- *Language*: Go
- *Backend*: Gin
- *Frontend*: HTMX + Go templates
- *Database*: Turso or SQLite
- *Execution sandbox*: WebAssembly via Wasmtime

* üîß Runtime Requirements

To build and run submissions locally, the following toolchains are expected in the system:

- [[https://go.dev/][Go]] or [[https://tinygo.org/][TinyGo]] (for Go submissions)
- [[https://emscripten.org/][Emscripten]] (for C/C++ to WASM)
- [[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install][Rust]] + wasm32 target
- [[https://wasmtime.dev/][Wasmtime]] or [[https://wasmer.io/][Wasmer]] (though it can install wasmer with the ~--install-wasmer~ flag)

* üöß Roadmap

- [ ] Add time and memory limits per submission
- [ ] Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Add user authentication and problem progress tracking
- [ ] Add leaderboard and performance metrics
- [ ] Language support: JavaScript, Python, Zig, Lua
- [ ] Exposable API (endpoints offering both HTML or JSON)
- [ ] Admin UI/actions (modify data through app)
- [ ] Composable tests (create tests from code)
- [ ] Multiple sandbox options (besides WASM)
- [ ] Add my own sample of code problems

* üìù Status

The project is in active development and not yet production-ready. Contributions and feedback are welcome.
